# Space Mission Governance and Token System

## Overview

This Clarity smart contract suite provides a comprehensive blockchain-based governance and tokenization system for space missions, allowing for decentralized proposal management, voting, and mission funding.

## Contracts

### 1. MissionGovernance Contract

#### Features
- Create and manage governance proposals
- Voting mechanism with time-limited proposals
- Transparent voting tracking

#### Key Functions
- `create-proposal`: Only contract owner can create proposals
- `cast-vote`: Allows voting on active proposals
- `get-proposal`: Retrieve proposal details
- `get-vote`: Check individual voter's vote

#### Error Codes
- `err-owner-only` (u100): Action restricted to contract owner
- `err-not-found` (u101): Resource not found
- `err-already-exists` (u102): Duplicate resource
- `err-voting-closed` (u103): Voting period has ended

### 2. SpaceMissionToken Contract

#### Features
- Fungible token (FT) for space mission funding
- Mission creation and milestone tracking
- Token minting and transfer capabilities

#### Key Functions
- `mint`: Mint new tokens (owner-only)
- `transfer`: Transfer tokens between principals
- `create-mission`: Define a new space mission with milestone funding
- `fund-mission`: Add funding to a specific mission
- `release-milestone`: Progressively release mission funding

#### Error Codes
- `err-owner-only` (u100): Action restricted to contract owner
- `err-not-token-owner` (u101): Transfer by non-owner
- `err-not-found` (u102): Resource not found
- `err-already-exists` (u103): Duplicate resource

## Workflow

1. **Governance Workflow**
    - Contract owner creates proposals
    - Token holders vote within the specified voting period
    - Proposals track votes for and against

2. **Mission Funding Workflow**
    - Create a mission with predefined milestones
    - Fund the mission with tokens
    - Release milestone funding progressively
    - Track total funding and current milestone

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Create a mission with 3 milestones
(create-mission u1 (list u10000 u20000 u30000))

;; Fund the mission
(fund-mission u1 u50000)

;; Create a governance proposal
(create-proposal u1 
  "Mission Expansion" 
  "Proposal to expand mission scope" 
  u1000)

;; Cast a vote
(cast-vote u1 true)
```

## Security Considerations
- Only contract owner can create missions and proposals
- Voting is time-limited
- Milestone funding is released progressively
- Transfers and minting have strict access controls

## Dependencies
- Requires Stacks blockchain
- Compatible with Clarity smart contract environment

## Installation
1. Deploy `MissionGovernance.clar`
2. Deploy `SpaceMissionToken.clar`
3. Initialize with appropriate parameters
